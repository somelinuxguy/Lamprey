# Lamprey

## A network traffic suck-a-thon

Lamprey, as its name implies, sucks. It reads a config file and starts up a listener on that port. Then it will log what it hears from people who connect to that port.

You are then free to use that data as you like.

## An Idea for Usage

I find it useful for looking at what bots are currently hunting for on "open ports" on the Internet. Everything from dumb port-scanners to rogue web spiders, there is a lot of background noise on the tubes.

Think of it like radar stations all over the state. When one alarms that it senses a tornado forming, you can react! Security companies do this now then sell you the results.

Time to do it The Linux Way and just roll our own.

# Requirements

Python3
This Runs On: Linux, Windows, Mac

# This Code is an Unstable Horror Show
Do not ever run this.

Just be aware that I am doing this as a project designed to teach myself Python3. We don't learn unless we have a reason to. This is my reason to learn network code and apply my vast networking knowledge at a code level.

If you happen to use this, and it eats your server: You were warned. You should never run another guy's self inflicted homework and expect good things to happen. Also I'm kidding about things running on Windows. Windows is a horror show and nobody serious about network security research would consider it a good idea for a platform.

This file and everything here will be rapidly changing over the next four months. K thnx bai
